# Project Health App SuperCode

This was my final project for the first module of the SuperCode's fullstack webdevelopment Bootcamp.

## Introduction

In this project, I used only the initial knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript that I learned during the first month of the Bootcamp.

## Functions

Calorie calculator (Kcal calculator): A JavaScript-based function that allows users to calculate their daily calorie intake based on their personal data.
Responsive design: The page adapts to different screen sizes and offers optimal display on both mobile devices and desktops.

## Technologies

<bold>HTML5:</bold> Structure of the website.
<br>
<bold>CSS3:</bold> Layout and design (for responsiveness I used Media Queries).
<br>
<bold>JavaScript:</bold> For calculating Basal Metabolic Rate and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (for men and women).
